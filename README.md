# CRYPTEXT

### A New Way to Message Friends

Cryptext allows a user to select a secret passcode and use that to encrypt a message to be sent to a friend.
A person who has received a Cryptext can enter the associated URL to validate with the secret passcode that user
knows, too. With this information, Cryptext will unencrypt the message and print it to the screen to be read.

The application was built with Javascript and used the Firebase API.
